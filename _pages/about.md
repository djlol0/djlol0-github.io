About me
------
I am a recent graduate of The Ohio State University with a major in Communication Technology and a minor in Computer and Information Science. I currently have a position as the Sr. Desktop/Field Technician for Coldwell Banker in Columbus, Ohio. I have 4 years of IT professional experience and a CompTIA Security+ certification (see my certification badge [here](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/7eff1275-0e5d-4ff1-9663-7972415d2cb8?)). I pride myself in my work and am driven by the satisfaction of solving people's unwanted issues with technology!
