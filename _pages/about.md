About me
--------

> Your focus determines your reality. â€“ Qui-Gon Jinn

I am a recent graduate of The Ohio State University with a major in Communication Technology and a minor in Computer and Information Science. I currently have a position as the Sr. Desktop/Field Technician for Coldwell Banker in Columbus, Ohio. I have 4 years of IT professional experience with a CompTIA Security+ and eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester certification. See my badge [here](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/7eff1275-0e5d-4ff1-9663-7972415d2cb8?) and [here](https://elearnsecurity.com/verify-certificate/?c=92e5d329-64f2-4976-8753-e273e2487c17) (ID is 6665534). I pride myself in my work and am driven by the satisfaction of solving people's unwanted issues with technology! I am hard at work in carving my path to the cybersecurity field.
