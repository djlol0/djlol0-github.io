I am able to perform computer/tablet support and recommendations, iPhone/Android setup and troubleshooting, and also security recommendations to keep your information safe from bad guys.  Most issues can be resolved remotely, so no contact will need to be made!

If you are unsure if your issue can be answered here, contact me anyways! If I am not able to resolve your request I can at least point you in the right direction to suggested vendors to contact.
