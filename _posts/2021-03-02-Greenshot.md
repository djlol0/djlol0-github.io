From their [website](https://getgreenshot.org/) ->
>Greenshot is a light-weight screenshot software tool for Windows with the following key features:
Quickly create screenshots of a selected region, window or fullscreen; you can even capture complete (scrolling) web pages from Internet Explorer.
Easily annotate, highlight or obfuscate parts of the screenshot.
Export the screenshot in various ways: save to file, send to printer, copy to clipboard, attach to e-mail, send Office programs or upload to photo sites like Flickr or Picasa, and others.

Why use Greenshot
=================

Greenshot has been a life saver recently, especially during my new venture writing about my cybersec journey. You can easily capture portions of your screen (or the entire region) if you desire.

What really sets this program apart from other similiar software is its' ability to save to various destinations. If you want to have it save to a certain location autmatically, send to a word doc, copy to the clipboard (my favorite), etc, you can! You could even select multiple options if you would like.

Best part out of all of this is that it is open-source!
